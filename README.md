Brief of Creative Part:
I chose to implement the third idea recommended in the instruction.
- The player can switch to the advanced mode by pressing "A" and switch back to the basic mode by pressing "B"
- In the advanced mode, there will be two salmons. The player can only control (i.e., using the mouse and keyboard) that salmon that is closest to the mouse. All other features are the same as the basic mode.
